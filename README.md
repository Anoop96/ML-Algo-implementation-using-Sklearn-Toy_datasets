# ML-Algo-implementation-using-Sklearn-Toy_datasets


This contains various Regression Algorithm which can be used to train a model

Algorithm shown in this Repo are 
1. Simple Linear Regression 
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Multiple Linear Regression 
4. Support Vector Regressor
5. Decision Trees 
6. Ensemble Model- Random Forest

This all was done on a toy dataset which predicts the salary that can be negociated with person who recently joins on a position in a company

Finally, To summarise all this I took a real world dataset from UCI Machine learning datset - Combined Cycle Power Plant data in which we needed to predict the hourly 
Electrical Energy output.
For comparing the performance of the model we used the R-squared evaluation metric which gives the goodness of fit for the model.
